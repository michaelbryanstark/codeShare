# Welcome to CodeShare

## Introduction to CodeShare

As developers, we often look for a place to share and find code. CodeShare was created for that reason. During the creation of CodeShare, we looked to other platforms to find answers that would help us finish this project. Those platforms are StackOverflow, Mozilla, DevTo, etc. These platforms were the inspiration for the creation of CodeShare. CodeShare creates a community of developers where they can share their code and look for code.
